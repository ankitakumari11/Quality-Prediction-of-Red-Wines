# Quality-Prediction-of-Red-Wines
A data analysis approach has been proposed to classify wine into different quality categories. A dataset of 1600 observations of red wines was used in our analysis. As the occurrence of events in the dataset was imbalanced, we applied upsampling techniques to oversample the minority classes. This balanced data was then used to model a classifier that categorizes a wine into three categories as high quality, normal quality, and poor quality. Four different classifiers were employed viz: k-nearest neighbours, random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machine. The experiments show that the random forest technique produces the best results with the most accurate predicted values.
